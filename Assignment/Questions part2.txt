Q1: When you are not logged in, your are able to login, sign-up and explore the blockchain. Which database and ledger file do we need to check then? Since the are no central files anymore, it is for each node.
Q2: What to do when you sign-up a new user? Do we need to create a new folder for the data files? Or can we assume that we always login with the same two users (who have the data folder), and only add the new signed-up user to the database of thos two users.
Q3: In the assignment part1 we had the functionality that we check on login for pending blocks in the chain to validate. Is this still needed? I'am thinking of when you send a block over the network to other nodes, when they receive it, they need to validate it and add it to their own chain. Is the block status than directly VALID or is it still PENDING to wait for other users to confirm?
